                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developes rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage,resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>
                        

                    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communications and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the clients specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the clients goals.The end result is the right product , delivered on time, and on budget. </p>
